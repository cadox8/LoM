A Minecraft gamemode based on League of Legends
## What is that?

I, like a lot of people, play League of Legends (LoL) and I wanted to recreate it on Minecraft.
I saw [@Elicis](https://github.com/Elicis) has started the game, so I took parts of his code (exactly the shop). You can see his/her project [here](https://github.com/Elicis/LoM).
I also took some ideas from [@Cadiducho](https://github.com/cadiducho) to make the code more clear, efficient and beauty :purple_heart:, so thank you.

## Documentation
