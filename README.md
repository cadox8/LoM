A Minecraft gamemode based on League of Legends
## What is that?

I, like a lot of people, play League of Legends (LoL) and I wanted to recreate it on Minecraft.<br>
I saw that @Elicis has started the game, so I took parts of his code (exactly the shop). You can see his project [here](https://github.com/Elicis/LoM).<br>
I also took some ideas from @Cadiducho to make the code more clear, efficient and beauty :purple_heart:, so thank you.

## Documentation

I'm working on a wiki for the plugin.
